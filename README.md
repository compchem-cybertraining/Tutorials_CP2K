# CP2K/Libra Tutorials

In this repository you can find different inputs needed for doing nonadiabatic dynamics using CP2K/Libra interface. We have also provided a manual for CP2K itself in the `cp2k_manual` 
folder. There are different examples on how to use the CP2K/Libra interface and you can use them by simply modifying the inputs based on your system of study. Also, you 
can find some useful links below showing our codes used for two of our publications. The following links are the same as above but with different systems:
