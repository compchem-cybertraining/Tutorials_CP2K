CN1x1.xyz  is a large structure which you can use to carve out the C3N4 quantum dots

c3n4-qd.xyz is something i carved in VESTA, but this one doesn't add missing H

c3n4.xyz - the one prepared using iQmol - we automatically added H atoms, but need to remove some
           of the added ones manually to produce this file.
