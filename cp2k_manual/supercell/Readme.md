# CP2K for a thousand atoms system

Now, it is time to perform the calculations mentioned in the previous sections to a 2x2x2 supercell of (BA)2PbI4 with CP2K. The system contains 1248 atoms that are stored in `supercell.xyz`
file. Here, we will only study some types of calculations due to relatively high computational cost although the comoutational cost for such system seems to be pretty good.
Here are some results of the computation.
