# CP2K/Libra Tutorials

This repository contains input examples for calculations associated with NonAdiabatic Molecular Dynamics (NA-MD)
calculations, using CP2K/Libra interface. 

* [1. Basics of CP2K calculations](1_basics_of_cp2k) 

  We start with providing the examples of typical usage of CP2K, either on its own or in conjunction with Libra or other related scripts.

* [2. CP2K/Libra workflow](2_cp2k_libra_workflow)
 
  We then dive into a complete workflow for such simulations.

* [3. Extra resources]
 
  Here, we provide links to the repositories with the codes used in the following publications: 

  * [Nonadiabatic Dynamics in Si and CdSe Nanoclusters: Many-Body vs Single-Particle Treatment of Excited States](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01009), [Technical details](https://github.com/AkimovLab/Project_Libra_CP2K)

  * [Crystal Symmetry and Static Electron Correlation Greatly Accelerate Nonradiative Dynamics in Lead Halide Perovskites](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03799), [Technical details](https://github.com/AkimovLab/Project_CsPbI3_MB_vs_SP)
